# Project-Weather-App

A simple weather forecast site using weather API

Link to project: https://gaburielu.github.io/Project-Weather-App/

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Weather API

Not much planning or programming is used as it's a pretty straightforward project, I probably spend more time making the site look nice. First time using Asynchronous Code which includes JSON, async/await and working with API which in this project is weather API.

Optimizations

1. Could include a pop-up to display the weekly forecast when hovering over the weather icon.
2. Can include a local storage variable to store the user's last location input.

Lessons Learned:
Using asynchronous JS lesson from the ODIN project which includes promise syntax, async and await, how to use JSON and fetching data using an API.
